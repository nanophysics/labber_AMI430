#Oxford Mercury iPS

The available options (field axes and presence of switch heater) have to be set manually. It is highly recommended to start the driver as "get config".

The setting "SwitchHeaterDelay" sets the amount of time for the switch heater to settle. The driver will completely block while displaying a message "Waiting for switch heater" after each change of the heater setting. The optimum setting depends on the device and the default is set quite high. However, if you do not wait long enough before driving the magnet after switching you might risk a quench!

If the switch heater is on when driving the magnetic field, the driver will set the target field and start a ramp immediately. If the switch heater is off, the driver will turn it on (wait for it), set the target field, start a ramp and finally disable the switch heater again (and wait again). The latter method will save a lot of LHe if the fiel is mostly constant and only has to be changed once in a while.
