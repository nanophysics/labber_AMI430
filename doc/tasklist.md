### TODO - Lev/Benedikt

DONE: Lev: Benedikt will be back from vaction on 2022-09-05.

Create Notebook based on https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/driver_examples/Qcodes%20example%20with%20AMI430.html with all features we require at ETH.
This then is the requirement list for Hans to build the labber driver.

Question for Lev/Benedikt: What is `class AMI430SwitchHeater`? What functionality do we need?


## Agenda next meeting
I would like to have 1/2 h review (Lev, Peter, Hans) of what Lev archived on the AMI430 last Friday:

- DONE: Fixed IP
- QCodes / Notebook
- Proposal on datatypes used in the Labber Driver (Hans)
- Proposal on how to implement the Labber Driver (Hans).
- How does the "Switch Heater" work? (See mn-430-rev10.pdf page117, PERSISTENT SWITCH CONTROL)
- How to continue (handover to Benedikt)
