### TODO - Lev/Benedikt

DONE: Lev: Benedikt will be back from vaction on 2022-09-05.

Create Notebook bases on https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/driver_examples/Qcodes%20example%20with%20AMI430.html with all features we require at ETH.
This then is the requirement list for Hans to build the labber driver.

Question for Lev/Benedikt: What is `class AMI430SwitchHeater`? What functionality do we need?
